# Coding Challenges - Solution Elias

## Requirements/Introduction for Reviewers
1. Open up the File index.html in your browser. - There you will find the test Results of the Challenges.
2. If you want to see the output in Detail - check out the browser console.

## Structure of the Repository:
* Each Challenge has its own folder and its own JS File. (ChallengeXX.js)
* Each Challenge has its own Tests that are included in the End of the File. - keyword Boomerang Protection. ;-)
* In the Folder "Testfiles" you can find a Testfile to upload if you want.--> Challenge 3

## Feedback
I really enjoyed the task. The description of the second challenge is a bit short. I think different interpretations are possible.


# Initial Task

Code in JavaScript/TypeScript or Java is preffered but not mandatory.
